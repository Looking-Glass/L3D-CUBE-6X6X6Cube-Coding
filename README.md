# HOW TO PROGRAM THE 6X6X6 CUBE WITH ARDUINO

Step 1.     Followed the instructions in the Arduino_STM wiki: https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki/Installation

Step 2. 	  Unzip <L3D_CubePixel.zip> and <beta-cube-library.zip> and put these two libraries under arduino library folder  ..\..\arduino-1.6.5-r5-windows\arduino-1.6.5-r5\libraries

Step 3.        Restart Arduino IDE, then select Maple (Rev3) for programming.
**If you can not find Maple(Rev3) on the board menu, replace the Arduino_STM32 folder with this one https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32

**Enclosed two Demos x6CubeDemo.zip and x6CubeMusicPack.zip for reference, enjoy!

The Schematic and PCB source files can be open with Eagle PCB.
